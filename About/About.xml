Patches various medieval smelter mods to allow smelting the plants from dismarzero's VGP Garden Resources mod.

Patched mods include:

Lord of the Rims: The Third Age

Fueled Smelter

Requires VGP Garden Resources to do anything useful.

Thank you to dismarzero for his awesome mod.

Let me know if there is another smelter mod you would like patched.
