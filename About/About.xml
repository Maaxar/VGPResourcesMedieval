	<description>
Patches various medieval smelter mods to allow smelting the plants from dismarzero's VGP Garden Resources mod. Also changes the labels of the recipes so they are easier to identify in the recipe list.

Patched mods include:

Lord of the Rims: The Third Age

Lord of the Rims: Unlimited

Medieval Times

Fueled Smelter

Coal/Coal Extended (Adds the recipes to the Coal Smelter)

Vanilla Iron and Steel (Adds the recipes to the Bloomery, also added the standard smelt slag recipe which was missing)

Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Production (Adds the recipes to the Fueled smelter)

Requires VGP Garden Resources to do anything useful.
