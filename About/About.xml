Patches various medieval smelter mods to allow smelting the plants from dismarzero's VGP Garden Resources mod.

Patched mods include:

Lord of the Rims: The Third Age

Lord of the Rims: Unlimited

Medieval Times

Fueled Smelter

Coal (Adds the recipes to the Coal Smelter)

Vanilla Iron and Steel (Adds the recipes to the Bloomery, also added the standard smelt slag recipe which was missing)

Requires VGP Garden Resources to do anything useful.

Thank you to dismarzero for his awesome mod.

Let me know if there is another smelter mod you would like patched.
