Patches @dizmarzero's mod VGP Garden Resources to change the technology level and descriptions.
  
Modified research and descriptions to be medieval tech, mostly so I could use it when playing with the Third Age mod.

Allows reasearch and smelting of VGP resource plants at the fueled smelter when playing with the "Lord of the Rims: Third Age" mod. You actually already could smelt them at the fueled smelter, since it is based on the electric smelter, but you couldn't research the technology from the VGP mod if playing with Third Age because it was Industrial tech. I also adjusted the decriptions on the smelting recipes and the descriptions of the leaves so they don't mention electricity or magnets.

Requires VGP Garden Resources.

Load Order should be:

Core
VGP Garden Resources
VGP Garden Resources (Medieval Tech Patch)
